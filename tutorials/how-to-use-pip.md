# How to use pip?

**1.** Start by checking if `pip` is installed. If you installed Python correctly, it should be ready to go! Use this command:
```sh
pip --version
```

**2.** To install one or more packages manually (not from a file), use:
```sh
pip install package-name
pip install package-one package-two
```

**3.** To install packages listed in a file (e.g. `requirements.txt`), run:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4.** To upgrade an already installed package, use:
```sh
pip install --upgrade package-name
```

**5.** To uninstall a package, use:
```sh
pip uninstall package-name
```
